Solutions of the assignment questions :-
Ans.1 :- Primitive data types are primary data types which can store data of only one type.
	   In C language, there are 5 primitive data types that are as follows :-
		A. int
		B. char
		C. float
		D. Double
		E. void
Ans.2 :- Type declaration statements can be written outside the function body such as Global variables.
Ans.3 :- It is 4 bytes according to the gcc compilor.
Ans.4 :- Garbage value.
Ans.5 :- float takes 4 bytes in the memory while double takes 8 bytes in the memory according to the gcc compilor. Precision of numbers in double is more than in float as more number
	   of bits are used for storing the constant.
Ans.6 :- ASCII -> American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
Ans.7 :- Keywords are the words whose meaning is already being known to the compilor whereas a function is not known to the compilor; it is either created by the user or comes from the
	   library of functions that is stored at some place in the memory.
Ans.8 :- Modifiers are keywords in C which changes the meaning of basic data type in c. It specifies the amount of memory space to be allocated for a variable. Modifiers are prefixed 
         with basic data types to modify the memory allocated for a variable.
	   For Example :- Type modifiers signed, unsigned, long, and short are prefixed and used with integer base data types. Whereas signed and unsigned are used for char, long can 
	     	 		also be used for double base data types.
Ans.9 :- Yes, we can assign a character constant in an int variable because the ASCII value of the character will be stored in the int variable, since all the characters are ASCII value
	   equivalents.
Ans.10 :- False, because not every block of code is a function since there may be several different blocks in the program. We can put any number of statements in the program in a block
	    but that does not means that it will be a function.
